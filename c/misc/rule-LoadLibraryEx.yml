  message: "The `LoadLibraryEx` function is used to load DLLs dynamically. Depending
    on the filepath\nparameter,\nthe OS version, and the modes set for the process
    prior to calling LoadLibrary, DLL hijacking\nmay\nbe possible. Attackers can exploit
    this by placing DLL files with the same name in directories\nthat\nare searched
    before the legitimate DLL is.\n\nTo assist in preventing against this class of
    vulnerability consider: \n- Specifying a fully qualified path when using LoadLibraryEx.\n-
    Use the `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH` flags with LoadLibraryEx or with SetDefaultDllDirectories.\n-
    If you use SetDefaultDllDirectories, be sure to use the AddDllDirectory or SetDllDirectory\n
    \ functions to modify the list of directories.\n- Only use `SearchPath` if the
    `SetSearchPathMode` function is called with \n  `BASE_SEARCH_PATH_ENABLE_SAFE_SEARCHMODE`.
    (Note: this only moves the current directory to\n  the end of the SearchPath search
    list.)\n\nFor more information see the security remarks section of the MSDN documentation:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya#s\necurity-remarks\n\nFor
    general information securely loading dynamic link libraries, see the MSDN documentation:\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-security\n"
