  message: "Usage of the `open` family of functions may hint at a potential Time Of
    Check Time Of Use\n(TOCTOU)\nvulnerability. An attacker may be able to modify
    the file being specified by the `open`\nfunction prior to the `open` function
    being called.\n\nPrior to calling `open`, use `lstat` to open the file and confirm
    the attributes\nare correct. Then use `open` to get a file descriptor to this
    file. Call `fstat` on the \n`open` file descriptor to confirm that `st_dev` and
