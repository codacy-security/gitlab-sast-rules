  message: "There exists a possible race condition in between the time that `tempnam`
    or `tmpnam` \nreturns a pathname, and the time that the program opens it, another
    program might create \nthat pathname using `open`, or create it as a symbolic
    link. \n\nConsider using the `mkstemp` function instead, but be aware it also
    contains possible\nrisks. Ensure the process has called the `umask` function with
    restricted permissions prior\nto calling `mkstemp` and validate the permissions
    prior to using the file descriptor. \n\nFor more information on temporary files
