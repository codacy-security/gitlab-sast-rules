  message: "The `mktemp` function should no longer be used due to multiple flaws.
    Some implementations\ncreated random files by using known information like the
    process ID and a single letter. This\nallows for possible race conditions where
    an attacker could guess or manipulate these files\nprior to them being used.\n\nConsider
    using the `mkstemp` function instead, but be aware it also contains possible\nrisks.
    Ensure the process has called the `umask` function with restricted permissions
    prior\nto calling `mkstemp` and validate the permissions prior to using the file
    descriptor. \n\nFor more information on temporary files please see:\nhttps://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152425\n"
