  message: "Some older Unix-like systems, `mkstemp` would create temp files with 0666
    permissions,\nmeaning the file created would be read/write access for all users.
    \n\nEnsure the process has called the `umask` function with restricted permissions
    prior\nto calling `mkstemp` and validate the permissions prior to using the file
    descriptor. \n\nFor more information on temporary files please see:\nhttps://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=87152425\n"
