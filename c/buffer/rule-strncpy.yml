    message: |
      The `strncpy` family of functions do not properly handle strings that are not null terminated.
      It is recommended to use more secure alternatives such as `snprintf`.

      For more information please see: https://linux.die.net/man/3/snprintf

      If developing for C Runtime Library (CRT), more secure versions of these functions should be
      used, see:
