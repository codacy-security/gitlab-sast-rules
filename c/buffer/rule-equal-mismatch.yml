  message: |
    This function is often discouraged by most C++ coding standards in favor of its safer
    alternatives provided since C++14. Consider using a form of this function:
    (std::equal, std::mismatch or std::is_permutation) that checks the second iterator
    before potentially reading past its bounds.

    For more information please see: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm
  metadata:
    shortDescription: "Function does not check the second iterator for over-read conditions"
    cwe: "CWE-126"
  pattern-either:
  - pattern: "equal(...)"
  - pattern: "mismatch(...)"
  - pattern: "is_permutation(...)"
  severity: "INFO"
