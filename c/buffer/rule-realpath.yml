  message: |
    The `realpath` function should not be called with a destination buffer as it could
    lead to overflowing if the path is greater than PATH_LEN. It is instead recommended
    to call `realpath` with the destination buffer set to NULL and use the return value
    as the resolved path. Be sure to free the returned pointer as realpath will allocate
    the buffer internally using `malloc`. 
    
    For more information see: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realpath.3.html.

    Example:

    ```
    char const *symlink_path = "/tmp/symlink";
    char *resolved_path = NULL;

    resolved_path = realpath(symlink_path, NULL);
    if (errno == 0) {
      // ... use resolved_path...
      free(resolved_path);
    }
    ```
