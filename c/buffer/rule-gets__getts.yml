  message: |
    The gets() function reads a line from stdin into the provided buffer
    until either a terminating newline or EOF. This terminating newline or
    EOF is replaced with a null byte `'\0'`. No check for buffer overruns are
    performed so it is recommended to use `fgets()` instead.
