  message: "The `vfork` function is suffers from portability issues and is not recommended.
    In\nsome linux systems `vfork` is vulnerable to a race condition while the child
    process\nis running as the user's UID but hasn't executed `execve`. The user maybe
    able to send\nsignals to this process, which in `vfork` would not be sent to the
    parent process. As\na result a user may be able to cause a denial of service against
    the privileged process.\n\nUse `fork` instead and be aware of other potential
    Time Of Check Time Of Use (TOCTOU)\nvulnerabilities.\n\nFor more information please
