  message: "Usage of the `readlink` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check
    Time Of Use (TOCTOU)\nvulnerability. An attacker may be able to modify the file
    being specified by the `readlink`\nfunction prior to the `readlink` function being
    called. Additionally, care must be taken\nthat the buffer provided is large enough
    to hold the contents of the file. \n\nInstead of using `readlink`, use `lstat`
    prior to opening the file and confirm the attributes\nare correct. Then use `open`
    to get a file descriptor to this file. Call `fstat` on the \n`open` file descriptor
    to confirm that `st_dev` and `st_ino` are equal between the two. \nIf they are,
    it is safe to read and operate on the files contents.\n\nFor more information
