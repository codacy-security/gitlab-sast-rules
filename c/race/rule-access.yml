  message: "Usage of the `access` function call hints at a potential Time Of Check
    Time Of Use (TOCTOU)\nvulnerability. Using the `access` function to check if a
    file exists and is readable before \nopening it, an attacker can create a race
    condition between the `access` call and  \nopening the file. The attacker could
    replace the file with a different one or modify its \ncontent between the time
    the `access` function is called and the file is opened, thus \nbypassing the permission
    check.\n\nCall `setuid` to drop privileges on the process prior to opening any
    files. Instead of using \n`access`, use `lstat` prior to opening the file and
    confirm the attributes are correct. Then \nuse `open` to get a file descriptor
    to this file. Call `fstat` on the `open` file descriptor \nto confirm that `st_dev`
    and `st_ino` are equal between the two. If they are, it is safe to \nread and
    operate on the files contents.\n\nFor more information please see:\nhttps://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/FIO45-C.+Avoid+TOCTOU+race+conditions+while+acces\nsing+files\n"
