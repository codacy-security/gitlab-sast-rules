  severity: "WARNING"
  message: |
    The application was found using `noAssert` when calling the Buffer API. The `noAssert`
    argument has
    been deprecated since Node 10. Calling the Buffer API with this argument allows the offset
    specified to
    be beyond the end of the buffer. This could result in writing or reading beyond the end of the
    buffer and
    cause a segmentation fault, leading to the application crashing.

    To remediate this issue, remove the `true` argument when calling any of the Buffer read or
    write methods.
    The application should still handle `RangeError` exception cases where the offset is beyond
    the end of the
    buffer.

    Example reading from a Buffer without the `noAssert` argument and gracefully handling errors:
    ```
    // Create a new buffer
    const buf = Buffer.from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
    try {
        // Read a single byte from it, starting at offset 1
        const b = buf.readInt8(1);
        // Work with b
    } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof RangeError) {
            console.log('Invalid offset: %s', e.message);
        }
        // handle other errors
    }
    ```
