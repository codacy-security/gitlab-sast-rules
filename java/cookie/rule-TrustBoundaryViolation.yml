    message: |
      A trust boundary can be thought of as line drawn through a program. On one side
      of the line, data is untrusted. On the other side of the line, data is assumed
      to be trustworthy. The purpose of validation logic is to allow data to safely
      cross the trust boundary - to move from untrusted to trusted. A trust boundary
      violation occurs when a program blurs the line between what is trusted and what
      is untrusted. By combining trusted and untrusted data in the same data
      structure, it becomes easier for programmers to mistakenly trust unvalidated
      data.
