  message: |
    An authentication cipher mode which provides better confidentiality of the encrypted data
    should be used instead of Electronic Code Book (ECB) mode, which does not provide good
    confidentiality. Specifically, ECB mode produces the same output for the same input each time.
    This allows an attacker to intercept and replay the data.
