    This method is part of a REST Web Service (JSR311). The security of this web service should be
    analyzed. For example:
    - Authentication, if enforced, should be tested.
    - Access control, if enforced, should be tested.
    - The inputs should be tracked for potential vulnerabilities.
    - The communication should ideally be over SSL.
    - If the service supports writes (e.g., via POST), its vulnerability to CSRF should be
    investigated.
