    The software constructs all or part of an LDAP query using
    externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not
    neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify
    the intended LDAP query when it is sent to a downstream component.

  severity: "WARNING"

    category: "security"
    cwe: "CWE-90: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an LDAP Query
      (‘LDAP Injection’)"
