# ABOUT

This repository 'Test - Central Rule Repository' is created to test the assertions and ideas that can be implemented for the actual Central Rule repository.

The Central Rule repository is a separate repository where all the [Semgrep rulesets](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/tree/main/rules) created to-date are kept in a uniform  manner.

This [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/329730#note_568340262) frames the general context behind this idea.
