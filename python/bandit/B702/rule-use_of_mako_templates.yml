    Mako templates do not provide a global HTML escaping mechanism.This means you must escape all
    sensitive data in your templatesusing '| u' for URL escaping or '| h' for HTML escaping.If you
    are
    using Mako to serve web content, consider usinga system such as Jinja2 which enables global
    escaping.
