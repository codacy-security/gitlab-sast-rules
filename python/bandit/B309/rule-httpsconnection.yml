    The HTTPSConnection API has changed frequently with minor releases of Python.Ensure you are using
    the API for your version of Python securely.For example, Python 3 versions prior to 3.4.3 will not
    verify SSL certificates by default.See
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.client.html#http.client.HTTPSConnectionfor more information.
