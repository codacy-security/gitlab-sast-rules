  message: |
    Detected the use of eval(). eval() can be dangerous if used to evaluate
    dynamic content. If this content can be input from outside the program, this
    may be a code injection vulnerability. Ensure evaluated content is not definable
    by external sources. Consider using safer ast.literal_eval.
