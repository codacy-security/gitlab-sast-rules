  message: |
    Avoid using `dill`, which uses `pickle`, which is known to lead to code execution 
    vulnerabilities.
    When unpickling, the serialized data could be manipulated to run arbitrary code.
    Instead, consider serializing the relevant data as JSON or a similar text-based
    serialization format.
