  message: |
    Avoid using `shelve`, which uses `pickle`, which is known to lead to code
    execution vulnerabilities. When unpickling, the serialized data could be
    manipulated to run arbitrary code. Instead, consider serializing the
    relevant data as JSON or a similar text-based serialization format.
