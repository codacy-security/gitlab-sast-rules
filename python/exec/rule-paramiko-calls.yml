    Paramiko is a Python library designed to work with the SSH2 protocol for secure (encrypted and authenticated) connections to remote machines. It is intended to run commands on a remote host. These commands are run within a shell on the target and are thus vulnerable to various shell injection attacks. The scan warns the usage of "exec_command()" method advising the user to check inputs are correctly sanitized.
