  message: |
    Mako templates do not provide a global HTML escaping mechanism.This means you must escape all
    sensitive data in your templatesusing `| u` for URL escaping or `| h` for HTML escaping. If you
    are using Mako to serve web content, consider usinga system such as Jinja2 which enables global
    escaping.
